# Cocoapod Movie Micro Apps
Learn how to use cocoapod build simple movie app using Micro App Architecture by using the code from this [repo](https://github.com/AndrewBrehmAtDialexa/MovieAppMicro).

In iOS development, a "micro app architecture" refers to an architectural pattern where the app is divided into small, independent modules or components, each responsible for a specific feature or task. This approach promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the app codebase. Here's a simplified overview of how a micro app architecture can be implemented in iOS development

CocoaPods simplifies the process of including third-party libraries or frameworks into your iOS projects. Instead of manually downloading and adding these dependencies, CocoaPods allows you to specify them in a configuration file and automatically handles the installation process.
