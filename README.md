# Cocoapod Movie Micro Apps
Learn how to use cocoapod build simple movie app using Micro App Architecture by using the code from this [repo](https://github.com/AndrewBrehmAtDialexa/MovieAppMicro).

In iOS development, a "micro app architecture" refers to an architectural pattern where the app is divided into small, independent modules or components, each responsible for a specific feature or task. This approach promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the app codebase. Here's a simplified overview of how a micro app architecture can be implemented in iOS development

CocoaPods simplifies the process of including third-party libraries or frameworks into your iOS projects. Instead of manually downloading and adding these dependencies, CocoaPods allows you to specify them in a configuration file and automatically handles the installation process.

## Command for cocoapod
```pod install``` --> pod install is used to install the dependencies listed in the Podfile.

```pod spec create YourPodName``` --> while pod spec create is used to generate a new Podspec file for a new pod. This command appears to be attempting to create a new Podspec file for a CocoaPod named "YourPodName".

```pod cache clean --all``` --> This command is used to clean the CocoaPods cache and remove all cached pods. It can be helpful if you're experiencing issues related to outdated or corrupted cached pods. Running this command can free up disk space, but keep in mind that it will require re-downloading pods the next time you perform a pod install or pod update.

```rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData``` --> This command is not directly related to CocoaPods but rather removes the DerivedData folder, which contains build artifacts and intermediate files generated by Xcode. Deleting the DerivedData folder can help resolve various Xcode-related issues, such as build errors or corrupted build artifacts. Exercise caution when using the rm -rf command, as it forcibly removes files and directories without confirmation, and a mistake could lead to unintended data loss.

```pod update``` --> This command is used to update the dependencies listed in the Podfile to their latest versions. Running pod update will analyze the Podfile, fetch the latest versions of the dependencies, and update the project to use those versions. It's important to review the changes made by pod update, as it may introduce breaking changes or compatibility issues with your project.

## Podspec file example in Micro Apps
```
Pod::Spec.new do |spec|

  spec.name         = "CommonUI"
  spec.version      = "0.0.1"
  spec.summary      = "A short description of CommonUI."
  spec.description = "A CommonUI pod for demonstration purposes."
  spec.homepage     = "http://EXAMPLE/CommonUI"
  spec.license      = "MIT"
  spec.author             = { "Lee McCormick" => "lee.mccormick@dialexa.com" }
  spec.source    = { :path => '.' }
  spec.source_files  = "CommonUI/**/*.{swift}"
  spec.swift_versions = '5.0'
  spec.ios.deployment_target = "17.0"
  spec.dependency 'DataModels', '~> 0.0.1'
  spec.dependency 'UserData', '~> 0.0.1'

end
```

## Pod file example in Driver App
```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'Cocoapod_Movie_MicroApp' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for Cocoapod_Movie_MicroApp
  pod 'TabMicro', :path => './Libraries/Modules/TabMicro'
  pod 'HomeMicro', :path => './Libraries/Modules/HomeMicro'
  pod 'SearchMicro', :path => './Libraries/Modules/SearchMicro'
  pod 'FavoriteMicro', :path => './Libraries/Modules/FavoriteMicro'
  pod 'CommonUI', :path => './Libraries/Utilities/CommonUI'
  pod 'DataModels', :path => './Libraries/Utilities/DataModels'
  pod 'UserData', :path => './Libraries/Utilities/UserData'
  pod 'Navigation', :path => './Libraries/Utilities/Navigation'
  pod 'ApiService', :path => './Libraries/Utilities/ApiService'

end
```
